        "P1":"With a privileged location at the main entrance of Valverde and the riverside with the same name, Páteo Lima enjoys from the proximity of Évora, a worlds heritage city; important megalithic ensembles; Roman and medieval ruins and even an episcopal farm from the sixteenth century. Furthermore, Valverde is surrounded by the magnificent Alentejo landscape at the base of the Monfurado hills.",
        "P2":"This rural tourism unit results from the conversion of an old commercial point which, in its heyday, had mainly a grocery store, tavern, bakery and butcher, fed by the farm's own agricultural production. Therefore, this rural tourism is constituted by a set of three houses of typology T1, T2 and T3 and each apartment has a name from the way they were usually designated by the family, in the past."

     "P1":"The acquisition of the property by the family dates back to 1874, on the initiative of the promoter's great-grandfather – Custódio Joaquim – who began to shape a business that expanded over successive generations in this location, formerly known as Valle Verde. However, the nickname Lima only came to be imposed in the second decade of the 20th century, when the husband of his granddaughter Iria do Carmo took over the family, which was previously known as Ferreira. The promoter's grandfather – Custódio Ferreira Lima – was the first aggregating element of the two families.",
     "P2":"In addition to their entrepreneurial spirit, both families (Ferreira and Lima) shared a high sense of organization and zeal for the documentary archive, which has allowed their most recent descendants to rebuild not only their family history, but also the village and its ways of life that have marked the last century and a half.",
     "P3":"This was not, however, a mere “sales” place; it was also a meeting place for people, where village life unrolled and the world was interacted with, imprinting habits and ways of life on it. The passage of travelers has always been frequent, with various notes and photos sent from far away by those who made a point of explaining the experience lived here. However, the withdrawal of the youngest, in search of a better life, and the evolution of the market led, little by little, to its decline.",
     "P4":"The birth of Páteo Lima revitalizes the space and gives it a new function, so that it can be lived again, providing new moments of sharing between residents and outsiders and the possibility of rewriting the story that, one day, will be told to other grandchildren. Its distinguishing feature is accessibility for people with limited mobility.",
     "P5":"Benedita Lima was born in Évora, in 1963, having lived on the farm until she was 18 years old. At that time, she headed to Lisbon, to become a Psychologist, having stayed there, but the appeal of the “land” brought her back to her origins. She didn't come alone; she brought with her a new generation of Lima, willing to continue the dream of their ancestors.",
     "P6":"Having dedicated most of her professional life to promoting the inclusion of people in social vulnerability, especially disabled people, and defending the model of independent life, which advocates the right to active social participation of all citizens, each one to its measure, strives to contribute to this effect in all the projects in which she is involved, an idea that also led to the creation of this rural tourism unit, which is intended to be inclusive.",
     "P7":"At the time of the death of grandfather Custódio, almost simultaneously with that of great-grandmother Iria, in addition to the commercial part, the farm had an agricultural production area and several houses where the family and some tenants were distributed. However, after successive sharings, the Páteo Lima space now has only part of the original backyard and 4 houses completely remodeled: house 'of sales', glass house, coach house and bakery house, the owner and last but not least bakery house, where the unit's support services operate, including reception and the “oven room”, which can also be used for accommodation.",
     "P8":"Despite the natural irregularity of the land, the space that gives access to the houses was transformed into a common patio accessible to people with reduced mobility, with the possibility of accessing motor vehicles, which can be parked at the back of the main house. The patio's configuration favors interaction between guests, owners and local population, but visitors can also enjoy the rest of the farm, where they can count on a grill and picnic area, swimming pool, terrace for sunbathing, swings and activities in the vegetable garden.",
     "P9":"It is located at the back of the Casa da Padaria (bakery house). As the name implies, it was here that bread was produced, which was then sold in the store or distributed to the surrounding hills, inhabited at the time by large groups of workers who traveled from the North to provide their livelihood in picking olives and tomatoes. or rice. Adjacent to the house of the former matriarch of the family, it was expanded and transformed into the house of the current owners.",
     "P10":"The reception room is located in the former “House of the Oven”, a place where the just baked steaming hot bread batches used to pass, always giving off a “mouth-watering” smell. In addition to the welcome, in this space guests can take time to appreciate some elements that are part of the history of the place."
